# attribute labels not localized

## Problem

I have a product, shown in different storeviews with different languages, but the attribute labels are only using default on the product page, not the translations.


## Solution

I found a check I had never paid attention to, under "Super product attributes configuration" in creating the simple products linked to the configurables, there is a "use default" that is not checked. No bug here.
