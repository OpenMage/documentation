## Developer Info

you can build the docs local with make by doing `make html`, which then puts the generated html in `_build/html/`.

To setup the local environment to build the html you need python(3) with pip.

you then can install the dependencies with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Its probably incomplete, please open an Issue if you have still problems to build the html.
